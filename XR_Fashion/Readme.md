#### Project Description
Klurdy XR is a product that targets challenges faced by online shoppers in the fashion industry, mainly them not being able to try-on products, products not fitting when delivered and dealing with counterfeights. These challenges were amplified during the pandemic and our product uses 3D technologies and advanced algorithms to visualise product catalogs and create an experience where shoppers can try-on clothes using photos, live video feeds or in a virtual shopping center. Most fashion brands mostly have photo-based catalogs and our AI system can turn them into 3D formats automagically and the brand can mint them as NFTs. 

We intend to target fashion brands in UK and US, specializing in bespoke, office wear, workout cloths and evening wear for women. Our platform reduces returns and boosts brand experience for on-boarded fashion brands

#### Summary
Our XR marketplace has a collection of clothes from fashion brands and we were able to build 3D product configurators for bespoke clothing and better product visualization using AR-enabled mobile phones and VR headsets. Our virtual try-on feature is still in development mode. Users can also purchase NFTs of the 3D clothing, but currently in the testnet.

#### Next Steps
We need funding for adding more technical members to help us build the MVP and at least one partnership manager to aid in business development. Also we need to register a company in the United States. Also we're currently in the Oculus Launchapd Program and we're creating a virtual shopping center, to be launched in 3rd quarter of 2022.
