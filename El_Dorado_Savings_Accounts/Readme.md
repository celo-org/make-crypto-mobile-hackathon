#### Project Description
Several factors motivated us into starting this project:
- Even though DeFi has exceptional interest rates, UX hasn't reached maturity yet, almost all users we talked to found it almost impossible to understand, especially in regions like Latin America.
- Rates Traditional banking are on-pair or even lower than inflation rates.
- USD denominated financial products are hard to access in LATAM.
- We are looking forward to providing easy access to savings opportunities, directly  integrated with our p2p market.

We built the first Celo blockchain savings product specifically designed for the Latin American region. We allow any user with a cUSD or cEUR account to start earning interest paid weekly with the flick of a switch. We utilize Celo's DeFi ecosystem to generate it on behalf of the users.

This project is a a P.O.C. that's using a simple web3 script. We plan to migrate this to a series of smart contracts that can integrate several strategies according to users settings. We focused mostly on UX and research this time.

#### Next Steps
- We plan to release a beta version of the Savings Accounts in Q1 of 2022.
- We’ll implement better strategies keeping in mind that we don’t want users to engage in high risk activities without explicit consent. 
- We plan to start a user education program that will cover from DeFi protocols to best security practices. We think that this is key to get the Latin American community motivated.
- We’ll keep improving our UX/UI to further ease down the complexities of DeFi.
