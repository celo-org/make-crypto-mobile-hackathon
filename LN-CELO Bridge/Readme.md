#### Project Description
Onboarding new users onto a new network is difficult. LN-CELO bridge leverages the existing millions of users of Lightning Network and gives them the opportunity to be onboarded onto CELO in a few seconds in a completely trustless and KYC-free way.
Anyone with a CELO wallet and Lightning wallet can use this bridge to swap between two assets. Thanks to a smart contract with submarine swap capabilities, there's no 3rd party/custodial/trust or account required. Swap completes within seconds or user gets their funds back.

#### Summary
LN-CELO Bridge currently implements swaps both ways so users can go from CELO to LN as well as LN to CELO. But we would like to continue working on this to bring it to mainnet and do required testing to stabilize it and bootstrap it with enough liquidity to serve a large amount of users. Future improvements can include integration with a popular CELO or LN wallet to provide instant swaps within the wallet. This could bring great UX and quickest possible onboarding to CELO.

Here's a demo on testnet going from CELO to Bitcoin on Lightning Network: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJOyb1_k690&ab_channel=zitoshi

#### Next Steps
I would need funding/grant support to work on this more to completely implement all methods such as refunds and onchain swaps.
