#### Project Description
Ceres has a built in Cash In Cash Out in Brazilian Real so that users in Brazil can move from crypto to fiat in a seamless way. Our vision is that it will take less than 20 seconds for the user to make a request, and it to arrive in the user´s bank account.

Also, unlike other Yield aggregators, Ceres is focused on understandability and a simpler UX. It was designed for the user who is new to crypto to take advantage of the DeFi yields according to their risk profiles.). It will be easier to use and to understand, denominated in the native currency of the user (Brazilian Real), with a UX similar to investing through banks, with different risk tiers and it will make DeFi accessible to the average individual in developing nations, starting in Brazil (our home country).

#### Summary
Ceres aims to simplify the DeFi experience to make it easier to the people. 

We were able to implement a new UX/UI focused on understandability and ease of use. 

We started, but were not able to implement the Cash In Cash Out in BRL. We developed quite a lot of the back end with the PIX instant payment provider and designed the Cash In Cash Out UX, but could not implement it on time. 

In the near future, we will finish the Cash In Cash Out and make it 100% automatic, creating a seamless experience to exchange BRL to cUSD, and vice versa. We also plan to integrate with Kresko to show synthetic assets.

#### Next Steps
- To complete both the Cash In and Cash Out flow 100% automated, that we could not do it on time during the hackathon.
- To raise a seed round of $300,000 in investment so we can have a proper liquidity pool both in cUSD and in BRL, and to have runway for two years while we perfect our CICO into an API service that can be installed in third party apps building on Celo.
- To adapt the [Iddle Finance](https://idle.finance/#/) yield aggregator smartcontracts to the Celo blockchain, and build our innovations in UX and understandability on top of it.
- To make it accessible for anyone with a Celo Wallet, rather than needing to download our App. Connectable through Valora, Metamask, Ledger and others.
- To integrate with other projects, like Kresko. Therefore, people will not only be able to invest on Farms, but on synthetic assets on Celo.
