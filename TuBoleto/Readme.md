#### Project Description
80% of Latin American commuters use public transit on a daily basis, making it an important place to widen crypto use. The minimal fees are key for micropayments. We have spoken with hundreds of our public transit users and we know how taxing can be spending 4 hours a day on public transit. We believe Web3 offers the opportunity to change this citizens lives. For us making crypto an accepted form of payment is just the first step, we aim to empower the blue collar worker. The value of our approach is connecting the web3 new economy to the traditional IRL economy to really displace fiat. 

#### Summary
This is our first step, allowing the use of crypto as a means of payment for public transit. To do so people can connect their Valora wallets to send cUDS into TuBoleto. All of this inside TuBoleto. This ways users use their crypto to pay public transit by scanning a QR. Fares charged are defined by the distance traveled.
The next features can be seen in next steps, generally speaking its about rewarding users and define our tokenomics.

#### Next Steps
This is already a working solution, 500 buses already use our system and accept payments but now with this hackathon we are adding Celo. Our next steps with regards to the use of this means of payment are basically defining whether or not we would use cUSD or generate another token in which case we have to define the tokenomics, specially ways to earn the token  (like rewarding good user behavior, that is users who keep their sensors on and so provide useful information to the community) and promote its usage.
