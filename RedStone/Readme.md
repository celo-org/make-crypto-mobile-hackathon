#### Project Description
RedStone delivers customisable data feeds by using on-demand data providing model and on-chain signature verification. We support long-tail tokens, real world data, soon NFT related information and we're here to serve diverse needs in regards to Oracles datafeeds. You need data about Interest rates, indexes or stocks? With our scalable infrastructure we're able to bring it on chain.

#### Summary
We source data feeds from our providers and then store it cost-efficiently on Arweave blockchain (Arweave blockchain has been designed to store large sets of data). When a user in a Celo dApp wants to use our data, it is automatically fetched from the arweave cache and appended to the transaction data. Then our smart contract verifies if the data signature is valid and created by trusted data provider.
