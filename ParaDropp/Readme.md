# ParaDropp - Go Green, Earn Rewards.
## The Problem
Climate change is one of the biggest threats to existence in current times. Global temperature is rising at a rapid pace and we have very little time and resources to help reduce the effects of it.
Global and local tourism contributes more towards pollution and creates a larger carbon footprint due to rapid travel and food resources consumed.
Adoption of More Compact, Green + Quieter Last Mile Transport is Slow.
##Proposed Solution
A Blockchain based Spot Rewards Experience that
incentivizes people to use more Compact, Green + Quieter mobility
Tourists have three basic problems:
- Where to go?
- Where to eat?
-  How do we reach the destination?
##How It Works
1. Tourist wants to explore a particular place in the city.
2. Tourist gets to the location using Bikes (instead of ride hailing or taxi).
3. ParaDropp provides tourist with tokens based on choice of transport.
4. Once user reaches the destination, they can unlock a spot reward by:
 (i) Exchanging earned tokens for discounts and vouchers.
 (ii) Exchanging for CELO cash (cUSD or CELOs)
5. These rewards represent Carbon 'Micro' Credits.
6. Rewards are sponsored by entities looking to offset their carbon emissions via Carbon 'Micro' Offsets
## How we built it
We brainstormed a ton in the aspect of bringing crypto rewards to offset carbon footprint and fight against climate change and help make a positive impact around the world.
We used Figma to design our vision and MVP and convey the concept we envision.
We used React Native and contract-kit to build a basic project.
We minted a custom ERC-20 called PECO token, using Remix and solidity.
**And by using a lot of passion and thought around contributing to solve climate change and offset carbon**
## Challenges we ran into
- With little knowledge about tokenomics , it was challenging to figure out a way to distribute ERC20 tokens as rewards.
- We had to brainstorm a lot to envision the user journey and flow of the application.
- We also had difficulty using tools for development and design as had very little experience using them.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Passionately solving to tackle climate change.
- Making a viable business plan and user journey.
- Integrating Web3 into the platform to increase the proposition value of the idea and reward.
## What we learned
Learned a ton about solving business and UX problems, learned a lot about the web3 space, and explored topics such as carbon credits and offsetting carbon through mobility.
Learned Tokenmonics, web3 usage.
## What's next for ParaDropp
ParaDropp hopes to evolve into a multi-tourist platform that tackles all problems that tourists face while helping offset more carbon footprint and help the usage of sustainable transport and facilities. We hope to also evolve our token to provide exciting value for token holders who believe in helping for climate change.
