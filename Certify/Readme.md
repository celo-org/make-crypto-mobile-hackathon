### Project Description
<!-- Provide a clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engages the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users? -->
Create Verify and Manage Digital certificates Celo blockchain.

We propose a system for creating and managing certificates which is decentralized thus giving maximum security. All the data is on public block-chain therefore it can be easily verified by anyone. The stored data would be encrypted too. Our application consists of an User Interface for institutes/Authorities to create and revoke certificates. There is also provision for a central authority which verifies institutes for authenticity. The institutes signs each certificate with there private key which ensures no forgery can
be done, once the certificate is issued.
