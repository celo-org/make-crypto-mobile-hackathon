#### Project Description
Nowadays, people are used to see new NFT marketplaces being created. 
Nevertheless, they lose focus of what the intrinsic value of an NFT really is: Art. 
Our project begins with Marta, a digital artist who would like to create her own NFTs collection. However, once she looks up procedures about how to create a crypto wallet, she acknowledges the lack of appropriate instruments and specific knowledge and decides to stop trying, abandoning the idea.
That’s why Glowe was conceived in the first place: to give all Artists the opportunity to access this ecosystem, shape their own Art and monetize from their creations. At the same time, our project is of great support to the crypto ecosystem, since it widens the access to non-technical people too.

#### Summary
Glowe is the first artists-friendly mobile NFT marketplace. 
It enables everyone to access this field and to mint NFTs in an easy and intuitive way. 
It’s main features are:
- ability to clarify guidelines and training rules necessary to navigate the NFT world;
- an easy and intuitive user interface;
- minting without crypto: by using our credits, it eliminates the process of depositing virtual money into wallets;
- possibility of buying and selling through a common currency: $;
- private and public minting: Artists can choose whether to publish their NFTs on the blockchain or keep them to their private profile (our DB);
- NFT portfolio: ability to view and display NFTs in full screen.
We are planning to launch a collection of 10k NFTs, with the aim to sponsor our project and to self-finance its development.
Keeping in mind the need to guarantee a quick and easy access to the NFT ecosystem for everyone, we believe the crypto world should not be an elite prerogative only, It should be a democratic space where one can make safe use of NFTs and the related earnings.
As for the complete product development, we will proceed with the launch of the portfolio section first and of the marketplace segment to follow. 
We are looking for funds and support in order to make this vision come true!
