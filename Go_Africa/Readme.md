# Go Africa

## Project Description

### Inspiration
Micro- or small-scale farming is the main source of income for more than half a billion Africans. However, Africa's agricultural productivity is among the lowest in the world. According to the World Bank, an investment of **80 billion USD per year** is needed to meet Africa's food demand. Access to appropriate financial services is therefore a prerequisite for realizing the potential of African agriculture, but so far less than 3% of bank credit is allocated to this sector. Considering the development of this sector therefore means finding a more democratized solution for financing the agro pastoral sector's entrepreneurs. This is the objective of the Go Africa platform, which will allow each producer to obtain financing for his project in the form of a loan on our platform.

### What it does:
Go-Africa is the first African crowd funding platform dedicated to the financing of agro pastoral projects, so the objective is to serve as a bridge between the diaspora and innovative projects in the agro pastoral sector. Go-Africa has a crowd-funding platform that will bring together diaspora, project holders and technical partners, to name a few.

### How we built it
We build the app on both web and mobile to make it easily accessible for everyone. We permit creative agro pastoral project owners to create projects on the platform, once the project has been studied by experts and concluded to be profitable, the project is then approved and opened for investments. We choose to integrate Celo to facilitate investment transactions through investing with crypto currency, making possible for anyone to invest on the projects.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
This project in its experimental phase (www.go-africa.io) would have allowed us to raise already **40 million CFA francs loan** about the equivalent of **70,000 dollars in 3 months** and we do not intend to stop there. We have just developed a beta version of our project on Celo's Blockchain as a mobile application that would allow any project owner to see his project financed once validated by investors through cUSD. This application using Celo's Blockchain and smart contract in the investment process.

### What's next for Go Africa
In the coming days we plan to campaign to African producers and young people to finance as many projects as possible in the next 5 years in order to gain experience in managing agricultural projects and to build a large community around our project. This community will allow us to support the launch of our **ADC Token (Africa Dream Coin)** which will be the first token in the world of crypto currency dedicated solely to the agricultural sector. We expect this to be done with the support of Celo.
