#### Project Description
Digitalstage.io is Web3 for music and the creator economy. 

#### Summary
Digitalstage.io is looking beyond the NFT and aims to tokenize the entire music industry to bring artists and fans closer together.  With our app we will allow artists to sell merchandise, music, and concert tickets all as NFTs.  Allowing artists to finally know their fans and who their biggest superfans actually are using the Celo blockchain.  Our “NFT everything” approach will gamify music fandom and allow fans to compete to see who truly is the “biggest fan” by being the fan with the biggest artist NFT collection.
