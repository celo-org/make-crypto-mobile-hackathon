#### Project Description

DAOMe is a No-Code Creator Economy Platform. Marketplaces like Opensea are not Completely trustless. NFTs created using Opensea exists on Opensea StoreFront Contract. DAOMe solves this problem all the NFTs created on the DAOMe Platform all 100% owned by the creator. This is because every user gets its own NFT collection to mint NFTs from. Setting up Snapshot, Discourse and DAO infrastructure is cumbersome. DAOMe solves all this problems by providing a No-Code solution and making Web3 more accessible to the masses.

We intend to focus on onboarding influencers first by doing beta-access and then opening up the platform for everyone!

#### Celo Integration

I have developed two smart-contracts using the Solidity language which were deployed to the Celo Alfajores testnet:

-   Creators Registry contract: 0xF008a45c2C15B72E40D0F61c34c53cA9A4E134B3
-   NFT marketplace contract: 0x027Bf1D4516fC12A24a003C2eBb6bF15273044dF
-   Our front-end is able to interact with our custom contracts using ContractKit.

#### Summary

DAOMe currently is a No-Code NFT Marketplace. Soon we will allow permissionless Social Token launches making DAOMe permissionless token launcher. Finally we will move towards governance by allowing creators to decentralized their profile.
