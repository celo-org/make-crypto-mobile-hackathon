## Intro

### Project details

##### Hackathon Track

Interoperability Track

##### Region location

London, UK

##### Team

Karl Lee, dev


### Problem

'The next frontier in blockchain technology is communication', as stated by the team behind Wormhole bridge.

With DeFi apps, protocols, and financial products appearing in different crypto ecosystems, a major barrier arises.
Capital flows across chains are restricted by limited communications between them.

Without cross-chain communication, **crypto is forced to flow back to centralized exchanges or even to fiat off-ramps** in order to cross different chains.
Decentralized finance cannot be so decentralized after all if we rely on centralized actors for bridging.



### The role of Optics by Celo

Bridging assets across chains is often costly due to gas fees.

According to Celo's docs, Optics is expected to cut '90% of gas costs' compared to a traditional cross-chain system. This is because Optics is a protocol that facilitates communication without header verification.



### Barriers to adoption and development of Optics

Optics is currently in a beta release phase.

While security is always a key issue for cross-chain bridges, there is also a lack of information on how Optic's bridges are currently being utilized.

For Optics, we are currently lacking:

- Official or community dashboards for monitoring activity on Optics
- Analytics to indicate the most intensive uses of Optics and potential integrations with DeFi apps and protocols that could help exploit these opportunities
- A service for bridge users to monitor their cross-chain transactions in one place

<br>

## Optics Dashboard

Optics Dashboard serves several stakeholders:

- Provides activity and trends for bridge operators and developers

- Provides insights for blockchain teams that are looking to potentially integrate with Optics

- Exposes opportunities for cross-chain apps, protocols, and DAOs, that can integrate Optics to increase liquidity

- Allows bridging users to monitor their transactions in one place

### Features
