# ⚡ Optics Dashboard ⚡

Monitor the activity, metrics, and health of Celo's Optics cross-chain bridges in a single dashboard.

### Live Demo: https://optics-dashboard.vercel.app/

This is a submission for Celo's Make Crypto Mobile Hackathon.


## Intro

### Project details

##### Hackathon Track

Interoperability Track

##### Region location

London, UK

##### Team

Karl Lee, dev

<br>

### Problem

'The next frontier in blockchain technology is communication', according to the team behind Solana's Wormhole bridge.

With DeFi apps, protocols, and financial products appearing in different crypto ecosystems, a major barrier arises.
Capital flows across chains are restricted by limited communications between them.

Without cross-chain communication, **crypto is forced to flow back to centralized exchanges or even to fiat off-ramps** in order to cross different chains.
Decentralized finance cannot be so decentralized after all if we rely on centralized actors for bridging.

<br>

### The role of Optics

Bridging assets across chains is often costly due to gas fees.

According to Celo's docs, Optics is expected to cut '90% of gas costs' compared to a traditional cross-chain system. This is because Optics is a protocol that facilitates communication without header verification.

<br>

### Barriers to adoption and development of Optics

Optics is currently in a beta release phase.

While security is always a key issue for cross-chain bridges, there is also a lack of information on how the Optics is currently being utilized.

There are currently:

- No official or community dashboards for monitoring activity on Optics
- No analytics to indicate the most intensive uses of Optics and potential integrations with DeFi apps and protocols that could help exploit these opportunities
- No service for bridge users to monitor their cross-chain transactions in one place

<br>

# Optics Dashboard

Optics Dashboard serves several stakeholders:

- Provides activity and trends for bridge operators and developers

- Provides insights for blockchain teams that are looking to potentially integrate with Optics

- Exposes opportunities for cross-chain apps, protocols, and DAOs, that can integrate Optics to increase liquidity

- Allows bridging users to monitor their transactions in one place

### Features
