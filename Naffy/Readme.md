#### Project Description

The creator industry is a big one and its is getting bigger everyday. Despite this, Most creators do not receive the value of their creations. They are either cheated by companies that offer to pay them for creating on their platforms or not even getting paid at all.

So, I decided to build a decentralized and transparent platform where creators can be supported by their audiences and receive the value of the contents they are putting out directly.

Any CELO user who is a creator on any platform can create a creator account which is a smart contract instance deployed on the CELO blockchain. The creator accounts can there-after be supported by other CELO users who are his audience.

Creators can be supported with blockchain based assets i.e Fungible Tokens and Nuon Fungible Tokens and also Supporters can be rewarded by the creators with custom tokens and NFTs, Hence a "win" for all. 

##### Technologies

- Vuejs
- Web3.js ad Celo Contractkit
