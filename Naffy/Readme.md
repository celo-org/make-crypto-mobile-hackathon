#### Project Description

The creator industry is big and is getting bigger by the day. Despite this, Most creators do not receive the value of what they are putting out. They are either cheated by big companies that offer to pay them or not getting paid at all.

So, I decided a decentralized and transparent platform where creators can be supported by their audiences and receive the value of the contents they are giving them directly.

Any CELO user who is a creator can only create a single creator account which is a smart contract instance deployed on the CELO blockchain. The creator accounts can there-after be supported by other CELO users who are his audience.

Creators can be supported with blockchain based assets i.e Fungible Tokens and Nuon Fungible Tokens and also Supporters can be rewarded by the creators with custom tokens and NFTs, Hence a "win-win" for all. 

Currently, Creators can only be supported with tokens (CELO, cUSD and cEUR) and NFTs. 
All activities such as support, withdrawal etc that occur in each creator account is recorded in the deployed creator smart contract

#### Summary
During the hackathon period, I have been able to build the features below:

Current features include:
- Creation of creator accounts
- Support creators with CELO, cUSD and cEUR
- A dashboard for creators to see and manage their account
- Support creators with NFTs
- Creators can list their NFTs for sale
- Buy NFTs from creators
- Explore creators
- Creator withdraw 
- Transfer NFT
- Creator set up and update their profile

Features I'd like to implement include:
- Ability to withdraw to differnt account
- Decentralized community system for creators (using DAOs)
- Creators can Incentivize their supporters with NFTs and custom Tokens
- Honour Badges for Supporters
- Creators Identity verification
- Ability to mint NFTs and create NFT collections

#### Next Steps

This prototype was built during the hackathon period and it's still far from being completed. 
After the Hackathon, I plan to recruit more developers to work on this project and also build a suite of decentralized creator's tools and apps.
