##### Team Members
- Ankit Rastogi, Backend Developer, <br/>
                    Worked on the backend part of the project using various tech such as
                  IPFS,Smart Contracts,Livepeer Implemented live streaming feature using Livepeer which is a Ethereumbased protocol that distributes video transcoding work throughout its
                  decentralized network.Worked on smart contracts of uploading videos, and authenticating
                  users using smart contracts.Also worked on IPFS to store Videos and
                  Photos.Worked on frontend part of the project such as Go-Live page, Home
                  Page, View Video Page
- Rathin R, Backend Developer, <br/>
               Worked on Injecting web3 and 
                Authentication:Validation of Users (Registration and signin). 
                Storing Videos on IPFS(dec. storage) by 
                calling a smart contract and rendering them on Home Page.

#### Project Description
The project utilises the advantages of blockchain such as privacy and datasecurity and offers a next generation solution for video streaming bottlenect issue. 80% of internet is used for streaming videos and with time this is going to increase only and this presents a huge problem of infrasture required to meet the growing needs. Here comes the decentraised file storage system which makes the requirement of infrastrure for the same quality video steaming less.

#### Summary
The Platform enables users to upload videos on IPFS, do live video streaming using Livepeer protocol and also featatures such as like, comment, superchat, share also available. We used Web3 for connecting to blockchain, IPFS is being used to store videos and photos, Smart contracts are being used to store information of videos and also for User Authentication, we are also using Livepeer protocol for live video streaming on the platform.Livepeer is a Ethereum based protocol that distributes video transcoding work throughout its decentralized network. There were many challenges we faced during the development of the platform. As the technology we used is new so we ran into problems which we found difficult to debug. Also we started with a idea of making a fully decentralise platform using IPFS for databse also using Orbit Db but we ran out of time so we are using IPFS only for storing videos and photos. In future updates we plan to use OrbitDb for decentralise database on IPFS.
Accomplishments that we're proud of : Succesfully deployed three smart contracts on Rinkeby testnet, Implemented Livepeer API for live streaming, and used IPFS

#### Next Steps
We started with a idea of making a fully decentralise platform using IPFS for databse also using Orbit Db but we ran out of time so we are using IPFS only for storing videos and photos. In future updates we plan to use OrbitDb for decentralise database on IPFS. Also for live chat feature during live streaming we are planning to use Matrix protocol
