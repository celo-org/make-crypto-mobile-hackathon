## Project Name
Celo Staker
### Team name

#### Hackathon Track

##### Region location

#### Project Description
With the goal of Celo to make crypto accessible to people via mobile, it makes a lot of sense
to allow people to stake their Celo via mobile apps. Currently to stake Celo users have to download Celo wallet on their desktop or use Celo wallet for the browser.
This means that for someone who is already using valora to send celo to their friends or loved ones. They have to use a different app on their desktop to stake Celo
Our app makes it easy for users using celo on their mobile phones to send and stake small amounts of celo per every transaction. The problem that comes with using two different apps is that most users will only stake Celo if they want to stake large amounts. Our apps make it okay for users to stake small amounts of Celo per every transaction. Once their Celo is staked users can see their rewards right on their app creating an incentive for our users to stake more Celo. Most users feel like it takes a learning curve to start staking Celo, our goal is to simplify the process and make it easy for our users.


#### Summary
The app stakes Sends and stakes Celo.

#### Next Steps
Our next phase is to connect the Celo Staker app with third-party platforms like Bidali to make it easy for our users to use their rewards to purchase items plus we want to make the Celo Staker app the main platform that provides education on all opportunities/rewards that users can get if they are holding Celo.
