#### Project Description

MedCelo is a fully decentralized medical fundraising platform built using Celo Blockchain technology. MedCelo is focused on raising funds for medical infrastructures, patient's treatment, and medical outreach. Our mission is to reduce the number of death due to financial limitation and provide worldclass healthcare to everyone everywhere.

We believe everyone deserves to live irrespective of their financial capability. We are particularly motivated by the amount of death due to inability to pay treatment fees. Despite being a highly developed country, in the USA, 16.9 percent of adults between 18 and 44 stated that in the past five years they lost a friend or family member due to inability to pay for treatment. JH Tanne (2008) in a publication on the National Institute of Health website claimed that about 26,000 Americans die due to lack of health insurance.

According to World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO), about 7.2 billion people do not have access to essential health servive. Country leaders are also failing to invest in core health priorities and systems and the WHO has made a call that countries should realize that health is an investment in the future. However, a lot of countries worldwide couldn't meet up to health demand of its citizen due to political issues and terrorism.

Therefore, as individuals, we must come together to build a fully transparent system that could address these issues. At Medcelo, we provide a robust, trustworthy and reliable platform to raise funds for medical problems. Also, unlike other platform, we are fully decentralized and the funds donated goes to the defined cause directly without a middleman (not even us) - this ensures that the fundraisers receive their money as soon as the Celo blockchain network confirms the transaction, usually within minutes.

To ensure transparency and prevent scams, we've mandated that fundraisers provide medical reports or substantial evidence before being listed on our platform. The choice of technologies used in this project ensure that we can rapidly prototype and deploy our concept and improve usablity. Over the years, mobile technology has become a dominating force and more users access the internet through their mobile device. Therefore, with Celo - a mobile-first blockchain technology - we can do more.

#### Summary

MedCelo is a fully decentralized medical fundraising platform built using Celo Blockchain technology. MedCelo is focused on raising funds for medical infrastructures, patient's treatment, and medical outreach. Our mission is to reduce the number of death due to financial limitation and provide worldclass healthcare to everyone everywhere.


During the hackathon, we are able to produce a minimal viable product. The current version of the software can do the following:

1. Connect to Celo Blockchain network
2. Query the Celo Blockchain network and retrieve medical campaigns
3. Allow user to start their own medical campaigns
4. Allow users to view individual medical campaign
5. Allow users to donate to a medical campaign
6. Allow contract owner (admin) to screen and approve medical campaigns before going live

We are currently implementing a way to allow user upload files to IPFS directly from our website.

We would have love to do the following:

1. Implement a mailing system that informs campaign owners of their approval status
2. Implement WalletConnect instead of CeloWalletExtension

#### URLs
List any URLs relevant to demonstrating your prototype

#### Presentation
List any links to your presentation or any related visuals you want to share.

#### Next Steps
What do you need to do next to turn this prototype into a working solution?

1. Refactor the codes
2. Setup a nodejs proxy server to upload images to IPFS directly
3. Implement WalletConnect for mobile phone
