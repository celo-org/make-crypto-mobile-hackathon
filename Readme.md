## Developer tools and resources

This section contains information about some of the key tools and resources that will help developers start building applications on Celo.

For a comprehensive list of resources and information, review [Celo Docs.](https://docs.celo.org/)

### QUICK START GUIDES

View the [Developer Code Examples page](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/start) to get started using the Celo SDKs with guided coding exercises.

### TOOLS

#### SDKs

-   [ContractKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit)
-   Javascript package of Celo blockchain utilities
-   Manage connections to the Celo blockchain, accounts, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, etc.
-   A set of wrappers around the core protocol smart contracts to easily connect with contracts related to governance, validators, on-chain exchange, etc.
-   Includes [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/)
-   [Celo Ethers.js Wrapper](https://github.com/celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper) (experimental)
-   A minimal wrapper to make [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) compatible with the Celo network
-   [use-contractkit](https://github.com/celo-tools/use-contractkit)
-   A [Web3Modal](https://web3modal.com/)-like experience that injects ContractKit into your web-based application. Supports a variety of different wallets, including but not limited to Valora, Ledger, Metamask (Celo compatible fork) and any WalletConnect compatible wallets
-   [DappKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/dappkit)
-   Easily connect to the [Valora](http://valoraapp.com/) wallet with your React Native mobile application
-   Valora manages user account, private keys and transaction signing, so you can focus on building your dapp
-   Learn more and see the code with the [Dappkit truffle box](https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-dappkit)
-   [Python SDK](https://github.com/blaize-tech/celo-sdk-py)
-   [Java SDK](https://github.com/blaize-tech/celo-sdk-java)


#### Infrastructure

-   [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) provides a clean, intuitive UI where users can send transactions and interact with smart contracts
-   [Forno](https://stackedit.io/developer-guide/forno)
-   Node access service so you can connect your dapp to the Celo blockchain without having to run node infrastructure
-   [ODIS](https://stackedit.io/developer-resources/contractkit/odis.md)
-   Oblivious decentralized identity service
-   Lightweight identity layer that makes it easy to send cryptocurrency to a phone number
-   Blockscout block explorers
-   [Alfajores testnet](http://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/) & [mainnet](http://explorer.celo.org/)
-   [Stats.celo.org](http://stats.celo.org/) to check network activity and health


#### Networks

-   [Alfajores Testnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet)
-   [Faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) for free testnet CELO and cUSD
-   [Forno](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/forno) supports connections to alfajores
-   Requires Alfajores Celo wallet for mobile device testing (please request, support@clabs.co)
-   [Baklava testnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet) for validators and testing protocol changes


#### Ethereum Tools

-   Similarities between Celo and Ethereum means you can use many of the most popular Ethereum developer tools.
-   Celo supports the EVM, so tools for writing smart contracts in Solidity (or any language that compiles to EVM bytecode) are compatible with Celo
-   ERC20, NFT (ERC721) and other smart contract interface standards are supported, see [Celo for Ethereum Developers](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/celo-for-eth-devs)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

#### Ongoing projects
