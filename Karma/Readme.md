#### Project Description

Decentralized lending is still largely user-blind. There is no way for users to build a reputation that would grant them access to better borrowing terms (i.e. friendlier interest rates and collateral requirements). Our project aims to eliminate this friction by tackling the problem in three parts. First, we developed the Karma protocol, an API for bootstrapping reputation systems. This allows dApps to quickly track their users borrowing behavior across the entire ecosystem. After developing Karma, we started working on Principal, a lending market that implements the Karma protocol to enable users to lend and borrow tokens in the Celo ecosystem. Users may borrow any digital asset by offering Principal tokens as collateral. Interest rates and collateral requirements are a function of supply, demand, and a user's karma. Lastly, we aim to make Principal mobile-first to allow any smartphone to smoothly leverage Principal to exchange value and access the decentralized lending markets.

#### Summary

We have a basic version of the Karma protocol deployed. It supports logarithmic updates for DeFi and rolling average updates for e-commerce dApps. We are working on adding more update functions to support all categories of dApps. We are also currently in the process of forking Moola and integrating Karma to create the first basic version of Principal.
