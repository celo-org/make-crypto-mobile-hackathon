#### Project Description
Basically, we can buy and store crypto as a person, but crypto wallets are not designed for business. You can't run a payroll, can't pay your suppliers, and can't earn interest while spending. We come with a new kind of money market account, you can pay your employees, contractors and suppliers fee-free on blockchain payment rails with fiat or crypto and earn interest up to 5% on your treasury while spending.

#### Summary
We're planing to build Celo-backed AP/AR and Mass Payouts, which is helping international businesses who are willing to run their business on Celo blockchain (cUSD/cEUR). And our long-term vision, to simplify business operations/treasury management for Defi companies by building our payment stack on top of the Celo blockchain.
1. Fiat on/off ramp through [Ramp](https://ramp.network/)
