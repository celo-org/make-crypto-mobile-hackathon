## 3. Workflow
1. The [story](https://github.com/Wakala/wakala-interface/labels/story) issues contain wireframes, designs, Figma links, and context/acceptance criteria.

2. Progress is tracked on the [Kanban board project](https://github.com/WakalaDAO/wakala-interface/projects/3).

3. Keep your PRs small. PRs require 3 reviewers.

4. For finished UIs: Move them to column "4. Feedback | Testing" on the [Kanban board](https://github.com/WakalaDAO/wakala-interface/projects/3) and assign them to [@ChegeMartinx](https://github.com/ChegeMartinx) for testing. 

5. For integrated UIs/stories: Move them to column "6. Testing" on the [Kanban board](https://github.com/WakalaDAO/wakala-interface/projects/3) and assign them to @SteffenKrogmann](https://github.com/SteffenKrogmann) for testing.

6. Never close an issue, just reassign.
