### Bot Boxer
#### NFT, Gaming and Creator Track

##### NJ, USA

##### Team Members
- Mike Walters, front-end
- Sean Devlin, solidity

#### Project Description
This project is intended for the casual gamer who is looking to take ownership of their objects within a game and lightly touch on their interest of competition while having skin in the game. 

#### Summary
Bot Boxer allows the users to mint NFT robots and respective accessories (shield, sword, AI chip, saw) and compete in a tournament round robin. Prior to competition the user can "train" their robot by adding them to our training module which takes the robot NFT out of playable commission while increasing their skill attributes (agility, strength, defense and intelligence) essentially a "train to earn" model. The smart contracts also allow for the user to ante a preset amount of CELO as a small commitment to their robot. The winner of the battle will receive the ante'd CELO.

#### Next Steps
We have a number of features built into the smart contracts that will be baked into the front end as well. For example, there is a contract that allows for the user to bet on their robot by anty'ing a preset amount.
