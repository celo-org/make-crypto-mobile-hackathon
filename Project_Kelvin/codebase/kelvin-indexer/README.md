# Fayyr Indexer 

## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

An indexer that catches specific methods for any desired deployed contracts and relays information to a CRUD web API. 

## TODO / DONE

- [x] basic indexer working
- [x] match statements to determine which method has been called
- [x] struct for passing information to database
- [x] picking up cross-contract calls
- [x] connect to CRUD Web API to do posts
- [x] finish writing up documentation for how to use

## Background Information

- This indexer currently catches specific methods on a modified version of [Matt Lockyer's NFT Marketplace contract](https://github.com/BenKurrek/nft-market)
- To change the desired contract that the indexer will look for, simply go to the function `is_fayyr_receipt` and change the accountId accordingly. 
- In order to make a POST to an API, you will need to uncomment the lines of code in the `remove_token_forsale_database`, `insert_token_forsale_database`, and `update_token_forsale_database` functions and add a valid URL. 

## Running Indexer

1. Install dependencies and compile code using `cargo check`
2. Initialize config using `cargo run -- init`
3. Run indexer using `cargo run -- run`

### Troubleshooting

If `cargo run -- run` fails, navigate to your `./near` directory (which is usually in your home directory) and open the `config.json` file. 
Scroll to the bottom of the file and replace `"tracked_shards": [],` with `"tracked_shards": [0],`

## Complete Guide To Local Testing

- Make sure the indexer is running by calling `cargo run -- run` as mentioned above. 
- In a new terminal, navigate to the `nft-market` directory
- The first thing you want to do is to set the `NEAR_ENV` variable by calling:
  ```bash
  export NEAR_ENV=localnet
  ```
- Build all the NFT and Market contracts using the following command: 
  ```bash
  cd contracts/nft-simple && ./build.sh && cd ../.. && cd contracts/market-simple && ./build.sh && cd ../..
  ```
  This will create the wasm files that will be deployed to the local network. 
- Deploy the NFT contract using:
  ```bash
  near deploy --wasmFile out/main.wasm --accountId test.near
  ```
- Instantiate a new instance of the NFT contract using: 
  ```bash
  near call --accountId test.near test.near new '{"owner_id": "test.near", "metadata": {"spec": "1.0.0", "name": "TESTING CONTRACT", "symbol": "N/A"}}'
  ```
- Create a subaccount that can be used to deploy the market contract using:
  ```bash
  near create-account market.test.near --masterAccount test.near --initialBalance=40 --keyPath ~/.near/validator_key.json
  ```
- Deploy the market contract using:
  ```bash
  near deploy --wasmFile out/market.wasm --accountId market.test.near
  ```
- Instantiate a new instance of the market contract:
  ```bash
  near call --accountId market.test.near market.test.near new '{"owner_id": "market.test.near"}'
  ```
  The indexer should pickup this transaction and print the execution outcome and display that a transaction was called. 
- You now have a market contract and NFT contract deployed on your local network which you can play around with and see if the indexer picks up methods called on the market contract.

## Useful Contract calls For Testing

### View For Sale Listings
```bash
near view market.test.near get_sales_by_nft_contract_id '{"nft_contract_id": "test.near", "from_index": "0", "limit": 50}'
```

### View Tokens On NFT Contract
```bash
near view test.near nft_tokens '{"from_index": "0", "limit": 50}'
```

### Update Price (make sure the token exists)
```bash
near call --accountId ben.test.near market.test.near update_price '{"nft_contract_id": "test.near", "token_id": "3", "ft_token_id": "near", "price": "5"}' --amount 0.000000000000000000000001
```

### Remove Sale (make sure the token exists)
```bash
near call --accountId ben.test.near market.test.near remove_sale '{"nft_contract_id": "test.near", "token_id": "3"}' --amount 0.000000000000000000000001
```

### Place Item For Sale
```bash
near call --accountId ben.test.near test.near nft_approve '{"token_id": "3", "account_id": "market.test.near", "msg": "{\"sale_conditions\":[{\"ft_token_id\":\"near\",\"price\":\"5000000000000000000000000\"}]}"}' --amount 1
``` 

### Offer
```bash
near call --accountId bob.test.near market.test.near offer '{"nft_contract_id": "test.near", "token_id": "3"}' --amount 5 --gas=200000000000000
```

### Deposit Storage
```bash
near call --accountId bob.test.near market.test.near storage_deposit '{}' --amount 0.1
```

## Commands For NEAR CLI Account Stuff

### Create New SubAccount

```
near create-account bob.test.near --masterAccount test.near --initialBalance=40 --keyPath ~/.near/validator_key.json
```
