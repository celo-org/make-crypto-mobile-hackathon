#### Project Description

Into The Verse is the first token-gated pixel metaverse which is a replication of parallel universe offering economic incentives and contributing to Impact through play2earn Dungeon loot game, DeFi, NFT Marketplace. Every building inside the metaverse city offers different opportunities, be it Ubeswap Token DEX, P2E Dungeon Game, NFT Marketplace, ImpactMarket Camp for community impact, DeFi Pools, Yield Farming(coming soon), ownable Real Estate(coming soon) and so on. Players can connect using their Wallet, interact with each other inside common spaces, and engage in Gaming and Defi.

#### Celo Integration

ðŸŽ® Secure authentication using Metamask Wallet on **Alfajores Test Network**. Following Authentication Users need to choose their character/avatar inside the metaverse. These Characters are NFTs and can be upgraded using Cosmetics or changed.
ðŸŽ® In Game Store (NFT Marketplace). Inside the Marketplace, players can buy NFT characters, Weapons, potions which are to be used inside the multiple character NFT based Dungeon Loot Game
ðŸŽ® NFT rewards as Level Passes (can be seen inside the In-game inventory)
ðŸŽ® $cVRS token rewards from the chests inside the game. These rewards can be used inside the Metaverse to purchase items from the marketplace, swap to other assets inside the banks, donate to Impact via ImpactMarket and so on.
ðŸŽ® Every level completion results in minting of an NFT level-pass reward that acts as a POAP for the next level. In this way we aim to store the progress on-chain. Every game character is rare and has unique abilities.
ðŸŽ® Decentralised storage powered by IPFS
ðŸŽ® We used **Ubeswap** UniswapV2 Router and Interfaces to create a Token Swap (cUSD <->cVRS) and vice versa by adding liquidity to the cUSD/cVRS pair on Ubeswap. This DEX can be used to swap assets whenever needed as major transaction inside the metaverse revolve around the cVERSE (cVRS) token.
ðŸŽ® Players can also contribute to **community impact** by donating to charity and global causes for impact by visiting the **ImpactMarket** Booth.
ðŸŽ® View Punks inside our gallery and buy them on the marketplaces like celopunks.art
ðŸŽ® We are also working with creating our own **decentralised identity** for the avatars using 3ID and Ceramic, and even perhaps partnering nomspace, to give special access to players owning a .nom Domain on the metaverse.
ðŸŽ® Players will also be able to enter common spaces, where they can chat with each other and engage in fun activities like a metaverse Disco and much more.
