#### Project Description

MedCelo is a fully decentralized medical fundraising platform built using Celo Blockchain technology. MedCelo is focused on raising funds for medical infrastructures, patient's treatment, and medical outreach. Our mission is to reduce the number of death due to financial limitation and provide worldclass healthcare to everyone everywhere.

We believe everyone deserves to live irrespective of their financial capability. We are particularly motivated by the amount of death due to inability to pay treatment fees. Despite being a highly developed country, in the USA, 16.9 percent of adults between 18 and 44 stated that in the past five years they lost a friend or family member due to inability to pay for treatment. JH Tanne (2008) in a publication on the National Institute of Health website claimed that about 26,000 Americans die due to lack of health insurance.

According to World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO), about 7.2 billion people do not have access to essential health servive. Country leaders are also failing to invest in core health priorities and systems and the WHO has made a call that countries should realize that health is an investment in the future. However, a lot of countries worldwide couldn't meet up to health demand of its citizen due to political issues and terrorism.

Therefore, as individuals, we must come together to build a fully transparent system that could address these issues. At Medcelo, we provide a robust, trustworthy and reliable platform to raise funds for medical problems. Also, unlike other platform, we are fully decentralized and the funds donated goes to the defined cause directly without a middleman (not even us) - this ensures that the fundraisers receive their money as soon as the Celo blockchain network confirms the transaction, usually within minutes.

To ensure transparency and prevent scams, we've mandated that fundraisers provide medical reports or substantial evidence before being listed on our platform. The choice of technologies used in this project ensure that we can rapidly prototype and deploy our concept and improve usablity. Over the years, mobile technology has become a dominating force and more users access the internet through their mobile device. Therefore, with Celo - a mobile-first blockchain technology - we can do more.
