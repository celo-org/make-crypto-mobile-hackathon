## Project Name
Pixcripto
### Team name

##### Region location
South America, São paulo - SP, Brazil

##### Team Members
- Gustavo Toledo, Fullstack Developer
- Wellerson Rokembach, Backend Developer
- Vitor Araujo, Fullstack Developer

#### Project Description
Through the PIX payment method, which was created by the central bank, being the best means of value transfer in Brazil, working 24/7, we were able to make our platform do an automatic cryptocurrency purchase as soon as it receives a PIX transfer from a customer, making it easy for anyone to access the cryptocurrency market.
It is worth saying, PIX is a payment method used by 100 million people and 7 million companies in Brazil.

We had several challenges, among them choosing which database to use (postgres or mysql) and how to organize the routes for the frontend to communicate with the API. 

#### Summary
The project should work to make automatic cryptocurrency purchases as soon as it receives a transaction through the PIX payment method.

Currently it has the registration, login, and fiat money deposit functions, we would like to implement the withdrawal function, so that the customer can withdraw their cryptocurrencies and do self-custody.

Integrate cryptocurrency brokerages to make the purchase actually happen, integrate PIX to receive fiat money, and then the application will be up and running in a real way.
