# beNFT

This is the repository for beNFT, a solution developed by team 21 at the [Hackathon Defi para o Brasil](https://defiparaobrasil.com.br), which challenged us to think of solutions within the blockchain universe.

beNFT offers a dApp that connects NGOs and philanthropic organizations with people around the world who want to contribute. In beNFT, organizations can sell collections of NFTs to interested contributors as a means of fundraising.

For organizations, we offer an NFT production service, in the case of lack of time and resources to allocate towards this. They can also consult a dedicated dashboard to keep up with their campaigns and funds raised.

beNFT is built entirely on the Celo blockchain, allowing for fast transactions directly from your phone. Contributors that buy the NFTs will be helping a good cause AND getting an investment souvenir that can be used to spread awareness for the cause and influence more people to contribute. Furthermore, every time the NFT is resold, the organization gets a percentage over the resale price.

beNFT, marketing NFTs for good causes!

# Technologies used in coding

- [Celo platform](https://celo.org)
- Multiple blockchain related tools, such as [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) and [](http://hardhat.org)[OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com)
- [MetaMask](http://metamask.io) wallet
- Front-end frameworks such as [React](https://reactjs.org), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) stack using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for dependencies management

# Celo integration

We developed two smart-contracts using the [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/) language which were deployed to the [Celo Alfajores testnet](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/):

- NFT minter contract: [0x140D73fBFbCcA8dfb841c6fA844f72Abb6845D3b](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/address/0x140D73fBFbCcA8dfb841c6fA844f72Abb6845D3b/transactions)
- NFT marketplace contract: [0xFD96345185bd7cA6c66066050A5e444D56E844B9](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/address/0xFD96345185bd7cA6c66066050A5e444D56E844B9/transactions)

Our front-end is able to interact with our custom contracts using [ContractKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit) and [use-contractkit](https://github.com/celo-org/use-contractkit)

Integration tests were performed using accounts on MetaMask with test funds available from [Celo Faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet)
