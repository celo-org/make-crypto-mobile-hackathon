#### Project Description
Carbon accounting can produce unlimited amounts of money. Therefore it's possible only with multi-level anti-theft protection: The amount of payments should be limited at each level. Moreover, there should be a voting mechanism of carbon accounters.

It's a ERC-1155 token contract. The discrepancy is easily solvable by creating a ERC-1155/ERC-20 bridge. (I do have such one!)

It is accompanied with a simple Web dApp to retire carbon credits and with a partly developed dApp to vote for how much carbon credits to allocate and how to relate with another levels of accounting.

It can be used to count something other than carbon, like software developers' salaries (inside a company or in an open system), etc.

Users are carbon accounters and other accounters. The carbon credits could also be directly used as means of payments.

#### Summary
ERC-1155, Web apps. Anyone can create a new token. Token can be assigned "upstream tokens" that we convert to forth-and-back (e.g. carbon token of Europe would be upstream of the carbon token of Portugal). Usual carbon credits and retired (canceled) carbon credits. Transfer limits by amount and/or time.

The voting dApp is in Aragon.

I started to rewrite it in DAOstack, but lost the code.

ToDo:

- Finish the DAOstack Web UI.
- Make mobile app. (I am not a mobile dev, I need help.)
- An app for donations to fund retiring carbon (I have another similar donation app, also not audited).
