#### Project Description
This is a marketplace for NFT Tokens.
New games often are available as early access. In this phase the game finished, but a fan community can be build and the game designer get already an income.
NFTs are a good way to finance game development but also give the fans the ability to show up they founded the game.

The marketplace itself is a building block for a login solution, where user get openidconnect login if they own an nft.

#### Summary
The marketplace allows game makers deploy contracts and mint NFT Tokens.
The fan community can buy the nft tokens then.

The game hextris is not part of the hackathon and just embedded into our page.

##### How we built it

First we cloned a marketplace called crypto boys and modified it a little bit.
But in the end we decided to develop the smart contract from scratch.
Also the frontend was built from scratch.

###### Challenges we ran into

Sometimes there were problems to get tokens from the faucets.
We needed the tokens to deploy the contract.

###### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we deployed an erc721 smart contract and hosted a marketplace.

###### What we learned

We learned to deploy smart contracts and how to host web3 software on github pages.
We played with ipfs and learned how to integrate it into web pages as the data for the contracts is stored on ipfs while the
hash address of the data is stored in the contract.

#### Next Steps

An extra contract should be created to list all games which provide NFTs.
