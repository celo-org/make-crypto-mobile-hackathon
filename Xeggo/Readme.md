#### Project Description

Xeggo is a trustless money streaming protocol where the sender can stream money to the receiver account repeatedly like hourly/daily/monthly. This project will be used to facilitate the payment for freelancers, contract workers, grants, salaries, and any composable stream of value, with a continuous settlement and per-second netting for extreme capital efficiency.  

Let's say we have a foundation called ‘Zen Labs’. An everyday use case would be grants distribution. Let's say Zen labs decided to give a grant of 100k in 5 milestones/month to project capstone (some arbitrary name).  Capstone projects aren't sure whether they will grant on time or not (a very common problem in grant and freelancing space). The project owner will ask Zen Labs to use Xeggo for streaming the money. Zen Labs will lock up the money. Every month 10K will be going to the receiver with some additional interest ( ~10%, depends on interest).  If the project owner didn't meet the criteria, then Zen labs can stop the streaming. If not, the money will be continuously streamed. The theme here is to remove trust barriers through trustless products. Also, the receiver will be getting interested in it. So the capstone project owner will get 100k+interest as a grant amount.  For interest, we need to connect with compound relative products built on Celo.


A humble attempt to build a decentralized unified platform where one can manage the database of the employee as well as automate their payment on recurring basis. At Xeggo Application, you can
1. Enter the details about your employees.
2. Assign the role and manager.
3. Put the payment.
4. Automate the payment on an hourly/weekly/daily/monthly basis through using CuSD/cEUR.

Many more..
