## Project Description

Celo DeFi Spend enables direct and instant spending of cUSD on local products and services in the wallets that users already use and love. People are able to spend on Airtime in 13 countries, Mobile Money in 5 countries, 300+ Gift cards and counting!

### Inspiration

On Celo, people can _Earn_, and _Send_ CELO and other ecosystem tokens. However, there is an opportunity to make it easier to spend Celo, cUSD, and cEUR on products and services regardless of the country you are from and directly on CELO wallets like Valora app without cashing out to the bank.

This is why we built Celo Defi Spend.

The Earn program on Valora app helps increase adoption and also engagement for Celo and the ecosystem. And the existing integration for spending on Valora and other apps is a great start for enabling utility.

However, more than just enabling utility for Celo, the Defi Spend unleashes utility. Read on to see how!

### Summary

This project will unleash a new utility for Celo, cUSD, and cEUR on the Celo Wallet app and provides an easy way and for wallets like Valora to offer CELO to 300+ Gift Cards, Mobile Money in 13 countries, Airtime in 15 countries, and many upcoming products and services that is sure to delight users, keep them engaged in the app and unlock utility even in mobile offline contexts.

A user on the app will browse a list of products and services and buy it for themselves or send it to one or a thousand users with the click of a button right without leaving the Celo Wallet app.

For individuals looking to access Gift cards and other local assets like mobile money, they can directly access it in Celo Wallet app without paying bank fees or going to a bank account.

### How we built it

For the Hackathon, I [extended the Celo Web Wallet](https://github.com/Chimoney/celo-web-wallet) to include an additional feature in the same place as the other bottoms.

Then, I was able to generate a request to buy a product or service using the [Chimoney](https://chimoney.io/)'s API and have the user pay for the transaction.

The product service is then delivered to the user.

Next, I started working on enabling Valora users to directly spend on products and services as I noticed an opportunity to provide a better exchange rate when paying for African and Asian Airtime and to also support Mobile Money which is huge in Africa and requires to internet to work.

So Imagine:

- Celo to Mobile Money to anyone even without Internet connection in the remotest part of the world
- Celo to Airtime to support community events without having to Cash out to banks
