#### Project Description
Studies from the International labor organization show that more than 60 per cent of the world’s employed population are in the informal economy and are concentrated in developing and underdeveloped countries.

Since financial institutions require proof of income to give credit, the 2 billion informal workers around the world are imposed high interest rates or get excluded. Rotating saving and credit associations(RoSCAs) compensate some of the financial needs of the informally employed population.

They are groups of people that agree to make periodic payments and each period one participant gets the bag, the first ones to get the bag get an interest free loan and the last use it to save creating a microfinancial system from a trusted network.

Variations of this system have been used for many years in countries from Latin America, Asia and Africa.

The saving circles usually rely on one person who organizes the list with the order, keeps record of the payments, reminds people to pay and sometimes receives payments and distributes the bag. This person is very organized and trusted by everyone but needs to perform many activities so the saving circle is succesful.

#### Summary
Bloinx is an application where users will be able to create and join saving circles from their computer or phone. Since it will run on blockchain, payments and withdrawals will be done remotely and all of the transactions will be permanently recorded to get a reputation record.

Bloinx will perform most of the aministrator's tasks making saving with your friends easier!
